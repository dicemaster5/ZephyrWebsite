### Programming

##### Adrian Carter

I'm a second year BSc Computing for Games student and I created the initial first person teleportation prototype we chose to base our game off of, therefore I worked mainly on refining the player's teleportation abilities. The most challenging being the long range teleport. I created several other small mechanics such as various traps and hazards. I was also largely responsible for implementing the audio and hand animations towards the end of development. There are a few mechanics I made during development that didn't make it into the final game, including several iterations of a mana system for the teleportation abilities.

I also worked on some non-programming aspects of the game, including creating particle effects for the Updraft and Tornado prefabs and designing and creating experimental levels.

These are the main mechanics I am responsible for:
- Teleportation Ability
- Blink Ability
- Moving Platforms
- Spike Trap
- Dart Trap
- Jump Pad
- Implementation of Audio
- Implementation of Hand Animations
