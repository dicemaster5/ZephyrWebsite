Zephyr is a first person platformer inspired by games like A Story About My Uncle and Cluster Truck. We hope to create a fast paced competitive speedrunning game blended with an interesting narrative. It is designed for PC currently.

The player is tasked with traversing floating islands and avoiding dangerous traps in order to find artefact pieces in as fast a time as possible. The player has two unique abilities to help accomplish this, a short blink that dashes the player a few feet in the direction they are looking and a long range aimed teleport that can instantaneously transport the player to a platform within range.

After the player collects 5 artefacts, they then play a boss level in which they get to the end of the level and place the completed artefact. They are then chased by a Guardian Boss and have to make it back to the start of the level, now navigating back the way they came with extra hazards and changes to the level.
